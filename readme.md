Learning the Basics of Unity

Things I've learned to do:
- place a terrain (no hitbox yet)
- place simple 3D shapes
- mess around with the Transform property of a GameObject to edit position and rotation
- accept input from keyboard (WASD or arrow keys) to move a cube's position
- use AD/left-right to rotate cube so that player can turn it
- use Time class to deal with Time in a game
    - Time.deltaTime for time since last frame
    - Time.time for time since application start
- keep an object a set distance away from another object as the other object moves
- keep the object at the same location relative to the other object as the other object moves
- add sinusoidal undulation in the vertical axis using `Mathf` and `Time.time`
